# Forest-Cover-Classification

**Portfolio Project:**

Used deep-learning methods to predict forest cover type (the most common type of tree cover) in the Roosevelt National Forest, based only on cartographic variables. 

My final solution and best model for this project: forestcover_solution.py 

The confusion matrix, model accuracy, and model loss vizuals provided were all recorded for the best model.
